Hi Future Me,I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on where we are now and where we hope to be in the future.
I hope that by the time u read this you have learned a lot in school. I also hope Github is easy to use and that you have made some cool projects. 
On a personal note i hope that u have made some new friends and settled down in this big city.
